# Python Projects

## Overview
This repository contains small Python projects and exercises completed as part of a structured Python course. Each project is self-contained and demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts.

## Project Structure
- Each project is in its own folder.
- Trivial projects are kept here; larger or more complex projects may be promoted to their own repositories.
- Example structure:
python-projects/
├── hangman/
│ └── main.py
├── another_project/
│ └── main.py
└── README.md

## Guidelines
- Python files only; no generated files like `__pycache__/` or `.pyc`.
- Stage → Commit → Push workflow for all changes.
- Folder names are `snake_case`.
- One project per folder.

## How to Run a Project
1. Clone the repository:

git 'clone https://github.com/USERNAME/Python-Projects.git'
cd 'python-projects

2. Navigate to the project folder:
cd "projectname"

3. Run the ppython script:
python main.py
